# Documentation

Flavisa is a sort of forced portmanteau of Flash Video Saver.
Today, any decent media player software will suspend the screensaver when playing.
This is great, because you surely don't want the screensaver popping up over your show/movie/whatever in the middle.

Flash videos, however, do not provide such a feature, as the ability to control the screen saver is not available in Flash.
This program bridges the gap.
When it detects a full-screen flash video playing, it will suspend the screensaver for the duration of the video.

# License

Flavisa is Open Source software, released under the MIT license.
